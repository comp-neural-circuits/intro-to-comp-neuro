### Solution 2

One possible solution is the following policy
You can also think of a dictionary that exactly maps a specific action to each state, or a more random approach ....

```python
def policy_to_solve_the_task(**kwargs):
    
    if kwargs['state'] in [23,35,47]:
        return 1
    
    elif kwargs['state'] < 36:
        return 3
    
    else:
        return 0
```
