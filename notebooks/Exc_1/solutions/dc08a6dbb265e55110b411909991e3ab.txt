#### Solution 4 - What happend

We use the range function to define the range we want to loop over. In the inital example 
```python
range(2)
``` 
we will loop over the numbers 0 and 1. So the range function basically takes an argument and produces a list of integers that we can use to iterate. You can also change the starting value of the produced integers. For example

```python
range(1,3) 
```
would result in the numbers 1 and 2
