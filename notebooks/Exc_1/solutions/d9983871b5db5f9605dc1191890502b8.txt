#### Solution 5

1) we start with the integer 0 and we always end one step before the value x (i.e. x-1) that we provide for the range function (so we always iterate for x steps) as explained above already, you can also change the starting value by providing two comma seperated values to the range function

2) to get floating point steps we can multiply our integer values with the floating point number we prefer (for example 0.1)
