#### Solution 3 - What happend

1-4 We defined our variables (now we also define our time step dt)

5 calculating the instantaneous change in v

6 printing the calculated value, while also printing what the value is

7 setting v equal to its old value plus the change it experiences multiplied with our chosen timestep

8 printing v (and printing that we print v)

9 we repeat the steps 3) to 6)

Now thinking about even more repeats of these steps leads us to a very fundamental concept of programming:
