### Solution 4


### Before you read on

Maybe you encountered weird artifacts? 
It helps to change the timestep (when creating the model):

``` python
model_dummy = HodgkinHuxleyNeuron(g_k=g_k, dt=0.01)
```





### If you want to see the solution:


```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = [11,5])
colors = ['#a6bddb','#74a9cf','#2b8cbe','#045a8d']
for color, g_k in zip(colors,[20,30,40,50]):
    model_dummy = HodgkinHuxleyNeuron(g_k=g_k, dt= 0.01)
    
    model_dummy.run_simulation(500)
    model_dummy.i_e = 3
    model_dummy.run_simulation(2500)
    ax.plot(model_dummy.t_list, model_dummy.v_list, color = color, label = f"{g_k}")

    
ax.set(
    title = 'Membrane Potential $V$ or different values of $g_{K}$',
    xlabel = '$t$ (ms)',
    ylabel = '$V$ (mV)',
    ylim = (-82,45)
)    
ax.legend(title = r"$g_{K}$ in $\frac{mS}{cm^2}$" )
          
```

### what happened

The spike shifts to the left with smaller g_na. This happens because we now more easily reach higher voltage values to enter the self-excciting loop of the Na-channel because there is less K+ current already during small depolarizations. If the maximum conductance is too small, we already see spikes even with no input. the Na currents can always enter the self-excitation loop.

If g_na is too big, there will be no spike at all. We also see that the action potential becomes smaller in amplitude for higher g_k values.
