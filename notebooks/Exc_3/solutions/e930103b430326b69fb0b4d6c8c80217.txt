### Solution 3


### Before you read on

Maybe you encountered weird artifacts? 
It helps to change the timestep (when creating the model):

``` python
model_dummy = HodgkinHuxleyNeuron(g_na=g_na, dt=0.01)
```





### If you want to see the solution:


```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = [11,5])
colors = ['#a6bddb','#74a9cf','#2b8cbe','#045a8d']
for color, g_na in zip(colors,[80,100, 120, 140]):
    model_dummy = HodgkinHuxleyNeuron(g_na=g_na, dt=0.01)
    
    model_dummy.run_simulation(500)
    model_dummy.i_e = 3
    model_dummy.run_simulation(2500)
    ax.plot(model_dummy.t_list, model_dummy.v_list, color = color, label = f"{g_na}")
    
ax.set(
    title = 'Membrane Potential $V$ for different values of $g_{Na}$',
    xlabel = '$t$ (ms)',
    ylabel = '$V$ (mV)',
    ylim = (-82,45)
)    
ax.legend(title = r"$g_{Na}$ in $\frac{mS}{cm^2}$" )
          
```

### what happened

You can see two main effects on the shape of the spike:

1) It shifts to the right with smaller g_na. This happens because we need to reach higher voltage values to enter the self-exciting loop of the Na-channel (and this takes more time). If the maximum conductance is too small, we actually see no spike at all.

2) It becomes smaller in amplitude with smaller g_na. The maximum current we can induce is smaller if g_max is smaller which means that g_K will be more dominant when the spike happens.
