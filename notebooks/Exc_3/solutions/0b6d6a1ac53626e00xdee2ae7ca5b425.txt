### Solution 2

```python
def no_spike_1():
    
    # we will not generate a spike if the current is too small
    model = HodgkinHuxleyNeuron()
    model.run_simulation(100)
    model.i_e = 2.1
    model.run_simulation(500)
#     model.plot_voltage_and_gating()
    model.plot_voltage_with_input_current()

def no_spike_2():
    
    # we will also not generate a spike if the current pulse is too short
    model = HodgkinHuxleyNeuron()
    model.run_simulation(100)
    model.i_e = 10
    model.run_simulation(12)
    model.i_e = 0.0
    model.run_simulation(500)
#     model.plot_voltage_and_gating()
    model.plot_voltage_with_input_current()

no_spike_1()       
no_spike_2()
```

### What happened? 

In both cases we cannot activate the Na - self-exciting loop, such that the neuron does not spike. However, we still see the effect, that we have a small undershoot after the initial rise, even when the current remains, this is again due to the K+ channel that opens already du to the small depolarization we induced.
