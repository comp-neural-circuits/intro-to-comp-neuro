#### Solution 15 - what happend

You can see four different phases in this plot. 
The first shows the exponential decay with no external current. 
The second shows an increase of the membrane potential due to the external current, but it is not sufficient for the neuron to spike. 
The third is again a reduction of the membrane voltage due to the leak current. 
In the last phase we can see the neuron spiking, the applied current is sufficient to cross the threshold.
